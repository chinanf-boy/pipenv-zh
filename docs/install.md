This tutorial walks you through installing and using Python packages.

It will show you how to install and use the necessary tools and make
strong recommendations on best practices. Keep in mind that Python is
used for a great many different purposes, and precisely how you want to
manage your dependencies may change based on how you decide to publish
your software. The guidance presented here is most directly applicable
to the development and deployment of network services (including web
applications), but is also very well suited to managing development and
testing environments for any kind of project.

This guide is written for Python 3, however, these instructions should
work fine on Python 2.7---if you are still using it, for some reason.

☤ Make sure you\'ve got Python & pip
------------------------------------

Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that it\'s
available from your command line. You can check this by simply running:

    $ python --version

You should get some output like `3.6.2`. If you do not have Python,
please install the latest 3.x version from
[python.org](https://python.org) or refer to the [Installing
Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
section of *The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to Python*.

If you\'re newcomer and you get an error like this:

``` {.sourceCode .pycon}
>>> python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'python' is not defined
```

It\'s because this command is intended to be run in a *shell* (also
called a *terminal* or *console*). See the Python for Beginners [getting
started
tutorial](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/getting_started.html#what-is-python-exactly)
for an introduction to using your operating system\'s shell and
interacting with Python.
:::

Additionally, you\'ll need to make sure you have pip available. You can
check this by running:

    $ pip --version
    pip 9.0.1

If you installed Python from source, with an installer from
[python.org](https://python.org), or via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) you
should already have pip. If you\'re on Linux and installed using your OS
package manager, you may have to [install
pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) separately.

If you plan to install Pipenv using Homebrew you can skip this step. The
Homebrew installer takes care of pip for you.

☤ Installing Pipenv
-------------------

Pipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you\'re familiar
with Node.js\' [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or Ruby\'s
[bundler](http://bundler.io/), it is similar in spirit to those tools.
While pip can install Python packages, Pipenv is recommended as it\'s a
higher-level tool that simplifies dependency management for common use
cases.

### ☤ Homebrew Installation of Pipenv

Homebrew is a popular open-source package management system for macOS.

Installing pipenv via Homebrew will keep pipenv and all of its
dependencies in an isolated virtual environment so it doesn\'t interfere
with the rest of your Python installation.

Once you have installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) simply run:

    $ brew install pipenv

To upgrade pipenv at any time:

    $ brew upgrade pipenv

### ☤ Pragmatic Installation of Pipenv

If you have a working installation of pip, and maintain certain
\"toolchain\" type Python modules as global utilities in your user
environment, pip [user
installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs) allow
for installation into your home directory. Note that due to interaction
between dependencies, you should limit tools installed in this way to
basic building blocks for a Python workflow like virtualenv, pipenv,
tox, and similar software.

To install:

    $ pip install --user pipenv

::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::

This does a [user
installation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs)
to prevent breaking any system-wide packages. If `pipenv` isn\'t
available in your shell after installation, you\'ll need to add the
[user
base](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.USER_BASE)\'s
binary directory to your `PATH`.

On Linux and macOS you can find the user base binary directory by
running `python -m site --user-base` and adding `bin` to the end. For
example, this will typically print `~/.local` (with `~` expanded to the
absolute path to your home directory) so you\'ll need to add
`~/.local/bin` to your `PATH`. You can set your `PATH` permanently by
[modifying \~/.profile](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14638025).

On Windows you can find the user base binary directory by running
`python -m site --user-site` and replacing `site-packages` with
`Scripts`. For example, this could return
`C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python36\site-packages` so you would
need to set your `PATH` to include
`C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python36\Scripts`. You can set your
user `PATH` permanently in the [Control
Panel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb776899(v=vs.85).aspx).
You may need to log out for the `PATH` changes to take effect.

For more information, see the [user installs
documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs).
:::

To upgrade pipenv at any time:

    $ pip install --user --upgrade pipenv

### ☤ Crude Installation of Pipenv

If you don\'t even have pip installed, you can use this crude
installation method, which will bootstrap your whole system:

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/master/get-pipenv.py | python

☤ Installing packages for your project
--------------------------------------

Pipenv manages dependencies on a per-project basis. To install packages,
change into your project\'s directory (or just an empty directory for
this tutorial) and run:

    $ cd myproject
    $ pipenv install requests

Pipenv will install the excellent
[Requests](https://python-requests.org) library and create a `Pipfile`
for you in your project\'s directory. The `Pipfile` is used to track
which dependencies your project needs in case you need to re-install
them, such as when you share your project with others. You should get
output similar to this (although the exact paths shown will vary):

    Creating a Pipfile for this project...
    Creating a virtualenv for this project...
    Using base prefix '/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6'
    New python executable in ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/tmp-agwWamBd/bin/python3.6
    Also creating executable in ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/tmp-agwWamBd/bin/python
    Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.

    Adding requests to Pipfile's [packages]...
    P.S. You have excellent taste! ✨ 🍰 ✨

☤ Using installed packages
--------------------------

Now that Requests is installed you can create a simple `main.py` file to
use it:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
import requests

response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/ip')

print('Your IP is {0}'.format(response.json()['origin']))
```

Then you can run this script using `pipenv run`:

    $ pipenv run python main.py

You should get output similar to this:

``` {.sourceCode .text}
Your IP is 8.8.8.8
```

Using `$ pipenv run` ensures that your installed packages are available
to your script. It\'s also possible to spawn a new shell that ensures
all commands have access to your installed packages with
`$ pipenv shell`.

☤ Virtualenv mapping caveat ============

-   Pipenv automatically maps projects to their specific virtualenvs.
-   The virtualenv is stored globally with the name of the project's
    root directory plus the hash of the full path to the project\'s root
    (e.g., `my_project-a3de50`).
-   If you change your project\'s path, you break such a default mapping
    and pipenv will no longer be able to find and to use the project\'s
    virtualenv.
-   You might want to set `export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1` in your
    .bashrc/.zshrc (or any shell configuration file) for creating the
    virtualenv inside your project\'s directory, avoiding problems with
    subsequent path changes.
